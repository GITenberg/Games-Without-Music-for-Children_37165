<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> object of these Games is to introduce
variety when it is needed in the ordinary
school routine, and to form a means of recreation
to the children when unfavourable
weather makes the usual playtime impossible.</div>

<p>Those of the Games referring to special
subjects, such as 'Sewing,' etc., may be
used in the lesson time devoted to such
subjects, and the 'Guessing Rhymes,' Nos.
<a href="#Game_51">51</a> to <a href="#Game_97">97</a>, may sometimes be given between
lessons. For notes on these, see <a href="#Page_87">p. 87</a>.</p>

<p>'Games for the Playground' and a few
of those immediately preceding are old
games with new rhymes.</p>

<p>It is hoped that some of the plays (Nos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
<a href="#Game_12">12</a> to <a href="#Game_20">20</a>, <i>e.g.</i>) will help to teach the children
important truths that are difficult for them
to learn in the abstract, but which represented
and practised in childish play may
make an impression on their plastic little
minds. Many of the Games are suitable
for home use, and will probably be played
there by the children after being learnt in
school.</p>

<p>If the Games help to make school brighter
and pleasanter for teacher and children their
object will be gained.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Cups and saucers, where are they?</span><br />
<br />
2. Put them at one end in rows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">See, a spoon with each one goes.</span><br />
<br />
3. One plate for each person bring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a napkin in a ring.</span><br />
<br />
4. Here's a jug of milk so hot,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sugar next, and coffee-pot.</span><br />

</div>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;The table may be laid by
two children only, or several may be employed,
but different children should take
part each time the game is played, so that
all may learn how to carry the cups, &amp;c.,
and how to place them.</p>

<p><i>Verse 1.</i> Two little girls step forward and
lay the cloth.</p>

<p><i>Verse 2.</i> The cups and saucers are
brought on a tray, and placed in rows at one
end of the table.</p>

<p><i>Verse 3.</i> One child brings plates on a
tray and places them one by one round the
table, while another follows with serviettes
on a small tray, and places one to the right
of each plate.</p>

<p><i>Verse 4.</i> The sugar, milk, &amp;c., are placed
in position.</p>

<p><i>Verse 5.</i> One or two plates of bread and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
butter are put on the table, and then the
chairs are placed ready.</p>

who are to sit at table take their
places.</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>THE BREAKFAST PARTY</i></div>

<p>This game may be played immediately
after the one preceding, or it may be used
alone. The children seat themselves at the
table, the 'Mother' sitting at one end and
the 'Father' at the other. When all the
cups are filled and passed, the following
lines are repeated:</p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />4. <i>WEIGHING</i></div>

<p>Scales and weights are required for this
game.</p>

<p>Before commencing let the children see
the different weights, and hold them one
after the other in their hands.</p>

<p>The following rhymes may assist the
scholars to remember the various weights:</p>

<div class='poem'>
1. First comes the <a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>ounce weight, small and round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sixteen of these do make a <a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>pound.</span><br />
<br />
2. Four ounces <a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>quarter-pound will be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><a name="FNanchor_4_10" id="FNanchor_4_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_10" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>Half-pound has eight ounces, you see.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>NOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Show ounce weight.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_8" id="Footnote_2_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_8"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Show pound weight.</p></div>

</div>
<p>The four weights given above will be
sufficient at first for little children, but more
may be added as they become familiar with
these. When the scholars have learnt to
distinguish the pound, ounce, &amp;c., they may
come out in turn and weigh various objects.</p>

<p>It would be well to explain that solid
objects occupy less room than lighter substances&mdash;that
a pound of feathers, <i>e.g.</i>,
would take up a large space, while a pound
of lead would go into a very small compass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guessing Game.</span>&mdash;When the object to
be weighed has been chosen, a number of
children are allowed to come out and hold
it in turn, and say what they think is its
weight. As the object is handed to the first
child, the teacher says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Can you tell the weight of this?<br />
Mind you do not guess amiss.<br />
</div>

<p>Each child takes the object in its hand
and guesses. The article is then weighed,
and the child who has guessed most nearly
its correct weight is allowed to choose the
next object for weighing, and to call out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
children who are to guess. He hands it to
the first child, repeating the words of the
rhyme.</p>


<div class='center'><br />5. <i>MEASURING GAME</i></div>

<p>Before playing this game, the children
should be well accustomed to the use of the
foot-rule, marked with inches (cost, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>).
Each child should have a foot-rule and
measure its book, pencil, desk, &amp;c.; it should
also be taught to draw lines of different
lengths with the rule on its slate; thus,
teacher might say, 'Draw a standing-up
(vertical) line six inches long,' or, 'Draw a
lying-down (horizontal) line four inches
long,' and so on. The children will thus
get accustomed to estimating the length
and breadth of objects, and will be able to
play the game.</p>

<p>Suppose the slate to be the object chosen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the teacher holds it up so that all may see
it, and then repeats the lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Think it over carefully,<br />
And tell me what the length may be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Of this slate.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The children who are ready to answer
then put their hands out, and the one who
guesses correctly (or most nearly correctly)
has the privilege of asking the next question,
and stands in front of the class in readiness.
Before proceeding, however, the first object
should be measured, so that all may see
that the answer was correct.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pencil may be the next
object chosen, or a window-pane, ball-frame,
desk, duster, book, &amp;c., and instead of <i>length</i>,
we may have <i>breadth</i>. The words would
then be:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Think it over carefully,<br />
And tell me what the <i>breadth</i> may be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Of this window-pane.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The children should be taught to listen
attentively, so that they may know whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
length or breadth is to be guessed; the
meaning of the two terms should, of course,
be explained previously.</p>

<p>If circular objects are chosen for
measurement, the word 'girth' must be
substituted for 'length.' This form of
object should only be used for the older
children, as it is much more difficult. To
measure a circular object, a string should be
passed round it, and the string should then
be measured with the foot-rule.</p>

<p>Sometimes the word <i>height</i> may be substituted,
as, for instance, in measuring the
height of a plant or a child. The children
will enjoy the latter very much.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Twelve</i> inches make a foot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>nine</i> a quarter-yard,</span><br />
The half-yard <i>eighteen</i> inches takes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To learn this is not hard.</span><br />
</div>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />6. <i>SHOPPING</i></div>

<p>The shopman should stand behind a
table or desk, and have articles made up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
parcels ready for sale. 'The Shop' described
in 'Kindergarten Guide,' p. 230,<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
would do nicely for this game.</p>

<p>The children who go shopping should be
dressed in outdoor costume, and each carry
a basket. They should also have money;
imitation cardboard coins (for cost<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) would
do. (Customer walks up to the counter.)</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Shopman</span></div>

<p>Good morning, ma'am, how do you do?
And pray what can I get for you?</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Customer</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Good morning, shopman, will you please<br />
To weigh for me a pound of cheese?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">[The packet is handed to customer.]</span><br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Customer</span></div>

<div class='poem'>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Shopman</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></div>

<div class='poem'>
And fourpence change [<i>giving fourpence to customer</i>] just twelvepence make.<br />
</div>

<p>The children should also ask for other
articles, without using the rhymes, and they
should be encouraged to speak clearly and
distinctly, and to address the shopman
civilly. This will be likely to assist them in
going errands for mother.</p>

<p><i>Instructions.</i>&mdash;The children should be
sitting at desks or tables, and each child
should have a &frac34; yard length of tape or
ribbon, one inch in width, and a book with
stiff cover. The teacher should first show
how to tie the bow by passing her ribbon
round the neck or wrist of a child, and
performing the various movements as they
are mentioned in the rhymes and shown in
the illustrations. This should be done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
several times very slowly, the words being
repeated either by teacher only or by all.
When the children begin to tie the ribbon
each round its own book, the teacher should
show the various movements as they occur,
performing them simultaneously with the
scholars. (The numbers refer to fig. 1,
which shows the various steps in order.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i035.png" width="200" height="156" alt="Crossroads" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;The children make roads by
standing in lines (see diagram). Four
children should stand at the place marked
&times; (see fig. 2), one child facing each road,
and holding in its two hands a good-sized
strip of cardboard, with the name of a town
or village to which the road is supposed to
lead printed thereon. It would be well to
use the names of places in the district with
which the children are familiar. Some of
the children must be little travellers, and
come walking up the different roads until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they reach the sign-post, then all repeat the
lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The little travellers do not know<br />
Which way to go, which way to go,<br />
But here's a sign-post that will tell;<br />
Ah! now they know the way quite well.<br />
</div>

<p>The travellers should be told the names
on the sign-post before starting, and each
should choose the place to which he will
journey. After the lines are repeated, each
traveller takes the road that leads to his
destination.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_12" id="Game_12"></a>12. <i>ASKING WAY IN STREET</i></div>

<p><i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;One of her Majesty's
inspectors remarked on one occasion that
he could judge of the intelligence and
manners of a school by the way in which its
scholars playing in the street would reply if
asked a question as to the whereabouts of
any particular place in the locality.</p>

<p>It is doubtless desirable that children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
should know something of the streets and
roads of the district in which they live, and
if they have clear ideas as to the meaning
of 'right' and 'left,' the following game
should help them in describing the position
of places.</p>

<p>The streets may be made by the children
themselves standing in rows, as in the
preceding game; or if the space available
be small, the children may stand round the
room, while the plan of the streets is chalked
on the floor. There should be one central
street, with others branching out of it right
and left, and each should be named. It
may be possible to arrange and name the
streets of some district with which the
children are familiar. The name of each
should be written on a card and placed at
the end of the street. The accompanying
diagram will illustrate the playing of the
game. We will suppose that a little girl
comes walking up Victoria Road, and at the
point &times; meets a gentleman (a little boy),
who asks, 'Can you please direct me to
Queen Street?' 'Yes,' she replies, 'it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the second turning on the left.' The place
of meeting may be varied, and the children
will then see that the terms 'right' and
'left' are interchangeable, according to the
direction in which we are walking. In the
following instance, <i>e.g.</i> Queen Street is on
the <i>right</i> instead of left. More difficult
questions may be asked as the children get
to understand better, such as, 'Which is the
way to Alexandra Road?' (starting from *).
'Take the second turning to the right, then
turn to left, and it is the first street on the
right.'</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />13. <i>POLITENESS IN STREETS</i></div>

<p>The streets (<a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>) of Game No. 12 may
be utilised for this game. The children
should have on their hats and caps, and
walk along the streets. The game is intended
to teach them how to behave when walking;
they should keep to the right, not speak
loudly, and the boys should raise their caps
when they meet anyone who acknowledges
them.</p>

<p>When the game is fairly started, the
two verses which follow may be repeated by
all the children:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Keep always to the right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in the street you walk,</span><br />
And please remember this&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not too loudly talk.</span><br />
<br />
We must not stare at folks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or turn to look behind;</span><br />
Be kind, but never rude&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A good rule you will find.</span><br />
</div>

<p>A little girl who is walking drops her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
handkerchief; then, after going a few yards
further, stops and says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Where is my handkerchief? oh dear!<br />
I must have dropped it somewhere near.<br />
</div>

<p>A boy who has picked it up advances
and offers it to the lady, at the same time
raising his cap, and the lady says 'Thank
you.' The game may be continued at the
teacher's discretion, and the verses again
repeated.</p>


<div class='center'><br />14. <i>DRESSING CHILDREN</i></div>

<p>About a dozen of the older children stand
in the centre of the room, and a number of
the little ones come in with coat and hat
in hand. The older children repeat the
verse:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Ready for the babies stand,<br />
See they come with hat in hand.<br />
Bigger children always should<br />
To little ones be kind and good.<br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>The younger children then advance, and
the others proceed with the dressing. First
the coat is put on and carefully buttoned,
then the hats or hoods are tied on, and the
little child says 'Thank you.'</p>

<p>This game should be played just before
the children are dismissed, or before playtime.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;How to tie a bow may be learnt
from Game No. 7, <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_15" id="Game_15"></a>15. <i>FATHER BRINGING PRESENTS</i></div>

<p><i>Object of Game.</i>&mdash;Anyone who has
observed children cannot fail to have
noticed how very often they have to be
<i>prompted</i> to express their thanks for kindnesses
received. It is hoped that this little
game may be of use in impressing the lesson,
so often reiterated by parents and others.</p>

<p>A 'house' is formed by a ring of children
(see <a href="#Page_ii">Frontispiece</a>, and description of same
on p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>). There should be three children
in the ring to represent 'John,' 'Maud,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and the 'Baby,' also an older girl for the
'Mother.' The 'Father' is supposed to be
away on a journey, and preparations are
being made for his return. The 'Mother'
and 'Maud' lay the table for tea (see Game
No. 1, which is similar), and the other two
children may be looking at a picture-book
or watching for Father's return at the door
or window. When he arrives, each member
of the family greets him; one takes his
hat, another his bag, and a chair is placed
for him at the table. Then the children take
their places, and the Mother pours the tea.</p>

<p>After the meal is finished, the Father
opens his portmanteau, and looking into it,
says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
A ball for baby should be here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[Takes out the ball and gives it.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Baby</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Father</span></span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">[Presents it to Maud.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Maud</span></span><br />
I thank you, Father, with a kiss.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[Kisses Father.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Father</span></span><br />
This cricket-ball for John will do.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[Hands John the ball.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">John</span></span><br />
Thank you, Papa, 'tis kind of you.<br />
</div>

<p><i>Frontispiece.</i>&mdash;Twenty or thirty children
might very well combine to make the 'house,'
instead of ten as shown here. The two girls
who cross hands form the 'door.' The boy
on the left of the door grasps the girdle of
the girl with his right hand, while the boy
on the right places his left hand on the girl's
shoulder to make the 'latch.' To open the
'door' we lift the 'latch,' and then push the
girl on the right gently inside the ring, the
girl on the left moving with her.</p>

<p>To <i>knock</i> at the 'door' we rap on the
floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />16. <i>GOING ERRANDS</i></div>

<p>The children join hands and stand
round to form a 'house' and 'garden' (see
diagram). A space is left for the gateway
of the 'garden.' For 'door' of house see
Frontispiece.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/i044.png" width="225" height="326" alt="House and garden diagram" title="" />
</div>

<p>In the 'house' stands one of the bigger
girls to represent the 'mother,' and there
should also be a little chair, and a doll's
cradle with a doll in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>In the 'garden' eight or ten children are
engaged in playing a game. ('Drop, Drop,
Drop,' No. 41, p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, would do nicely.) One
of the girls must represent 'Nellie,' and one
of the boys 'Johnnie.' As the game
proceeds, the 'mother' comes to the door
and calls:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Nellie, Nellie!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[Nellie at once answers:</span><br />
'Yes, mother.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[Leaves game immediately and runs to mother.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></span><br />
Baby cries, just soothe her, Nell.<br />
Rock the cradle; that is well.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">[Nellie sits down and rocks the cradle.]</span><br />
</div>

<p>The game proceeds for a little while, and
then the 'mother' calls again:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Johnnie!' [<i>Children say</i>], 'Mother calls you, see.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[Johnnie runs quickly to the 'mother.']</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></span><br />
Go round to the shop for me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[Gives him money and a basket.]</span><br />
</div> <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnnie may go outside the room and
come back again, or the game 'Shopping'
(No. 6, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>) may be played, having been
previously prepared in another part of the
room, and Johnnie may go to the shop for
what his mother requires. When he has
returned, all the children say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Little children, always run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When your mother's voice is heard,</span><br />
Leave your play whene'er she calls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quickly mind her every word.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />17. <i>TAKING FATHER'S TEA</i></div>

<p>A classroom may be used for the 'house'
and another for the 'workshop,' or they
may both be made by rings of children (see
Frontispiece, and description of same on
<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). Between the 'house' and the
'workshop' there should be a 'street' (see
Game No. 12, <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>). In the workshop
there should be 'joiners' planing, hammering,
sawing, &amp;c. (a set of toy tools might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
used for this), and in the 'house' a little
girl should represent the 'mother.'</p>

<p>Two children come walking quickly
down the 'street' towards the 'house,'
saying:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Straight away from school we go,<br />
To take our father's tea, you know.<br />
</div>

<p>They enter the 'house,' and the 'mother'
gives a jug to one and a basket to the other,
and says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
With care the jug of tea you'll hold,<br />
And make good haste lest it get cold.<br />
</div>

<p>Children reply:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Oh yes, dear mother, all you say<br />
We'll mind right well&mdash;and now, away.<br />
</div>

<p>They walk up the 'street' to the 'workshop,'
and the 'father'&mdash;a joiner with
sleeves rolled up&mdash;comes to the door.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Father</span></span><br />

<p>Children say 'Good-bye,' and run off.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>INVITATIONS</i></div>

<p><i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;Children should be taught
to express thanks not only for tangible
presents, as in Game No. <a href="#Game_15">15</a>, but also for
kindness or favours received. The two games
which follow are intended to teach this.</p>


<div class='center'><br />18. <i>INVITATION TO PLAY</i></div>

<p>A house with garden is needed; to make
this the children join hands and stand as
shown in diagram, <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>. In the 'house'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
there should be a 'mother,' and in the
'garden' a number of children playing with
ball or skipping-rope. A smaller 'house' is
required at some distance from the first.
In this, also, there should be a 'mother'&mdash;(Mrs.
Day), and a little girl&mdash;(Nell). A
classroom may be used for this 'house' if
more convenient.</p>

<p>As the play proceeds the 'mother' comes
to the 'door' to watch the children's game.
Presently one of them&mdash;a boy&mdash;runs up to
her and says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Mamma, please, may we ask Nell Day<br />
To come and have a game of play?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">[The other children come and cluster round.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></span><br />
Oh, yes! I will a message send&mdash;<br />
An invitation for your friend.<br />
Just go and ask if Mrs. Day<br />
Can spare Nellie to come all day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><span class="smcap">All the Children</span></span><br />
Thank you, mother.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy runs off to Mrs. Day's house
and knocks. Mrs. Day answers the door.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;"><span class="smcap">Child</span></span><br />
Please, Mrs. Day, may Nellie come<br />
To play all day with us at home?<br />
</div>

<p>If Mrs. Day says 'Yes,' Nell should
reply, 'Thank you, mother,' and Mrs. Day
should also send a message of thanks to the
boy's mother. When Nell is ready, they
run off hand in hand.</p>


<div class='center'><br />19. <i>INVITATION TO DRIVE</i></div>

<p>The house and garden described in
Game No. 16, p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, will do quite well for
this also, but the children are to be at work
instead of play. One child may be fetching
water, another minding the baby, and
another watering the garden or going
errands. A gentleman (boy) comes to the
garden-gate (a space is left for the gateway),
with 'carriage' and 'horses'; the 'carriage'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is made in the same way as the 'coach'
(Game No. 24, <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>), and has two horses
instead of four. Gentleman walks through
the 'garden,' knocks at the door, and says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Good morning, madam; if I may,<br />
I'll drive your children out to-day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></span><br />
<br />
I thank you, sir [<i>beckons children to her</i>]; come children! [<i>children run to her</i>].<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;"><span class="smcap">Gentleman</span></span><br />
Such busy, happy children, they<br />
Shall drive with me far, far away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;"><span class="smcap">Children</span></span><br />
Oh, thank you, sir, 'twill pleasant be<br />
To ride with you nice things to see.<br />
</div>

<p>Children enter carriage, waving hands to
'mother,' and saying:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Good-bye, dear mother, off we go,<br />
The horses gallop fast, we know.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_20" id="Game_20"></a>20. <i>GETTING READY FOR BED</i></div>

<p>This game may be used for a class of
children, or for a few only. In the former
case, the majority of the scholars would, of
course, be lookers-on.</p>

<p>Half a dozen boys and girls should be
playing in different parts of the room; one
might be drawing, another building, and a
third looking at a picture-book; or they
might all be joining to play a game together.
A big girl or the teacher represents the elder
sister, who repeats (or sings to the tune of
'The Campbells are Coming') the four lines
following:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Come, children, get ready for bed, bed, bed,<br />
And sister must wash you, as mother said,<br />
The hands and the faces will all be clean,<br />
Such nice, happy children, shall ne'er be seen.<br />
</div>

<p>The children instantly put toys and
books away in their proper places, and
reply:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
Some folks they do cry, when they're washed, oh dear! dear!<br />
Pray where do they live? We do not want them here.<br />
Merry, happy little children, come and get well scrubbed,<br />
But do not cry when you are washed and rubbed.<br />
</div>

<p>The 'sister' pretends to wash all the
children; then they say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Some folks they do cry when they're told, 'Time for bed,'<br />
Some folks pout and say, 'Oh! let me play instead.'<br />
Merry, happy little children, laughing go away,<br />
Good-night, good-night, we'll play another day.<br />
</div>

<p>The children go out of the room kissing
hands to those who are left, or to the elder
'sister.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />21. <i>WASHING ONE'S SELF</i></div>

<p>The teacher may repeat the lines,
accompanying them with the actions, which
the children imitate, or the children may
learn and repeat the words themselves.</p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />22. <i>ASKING FOR DRINK OF WATER</i></div>

<p><i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;This little game may be
used to teach children to be courteous to
strangers, and it should also teach them how
to carry liquid without spilling.</p>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;The school or classroom
should be the 'house,' and a boy (representing
the man who asks for water) should go
outside. One child is required to answer
the door, and another may carry the glass of
water, or the same child may do both.</p>

<p>The 'man' comes and knocks at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
door, which is opened by a little girl; he
then says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
A drink of water, please, I pray,<br />
You'll give me, madam, this hot day.<br />
</div>

<p>A child walks across the room with the
glass of water, which should be carried on a
plate or small tray, without spilling, and
hands it to the man, who takes it, saying,
'Thank you.' When he has finished drinking,
he returns the glass, and the child says
'Good-day,' and closes the door.</p>


<div class='center'><br />23. <i>THE FOX AND THE TIGER</i></div>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;The 'tiger' (a boy) hides in
a 'forest,' which the children make by
standing at irregular intervals and representing
trees. Each child should name the
tree it chooses, the following rhyme gives
the names of a few common trees:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Beech and chestnut, birch and oak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the names of English trees,</span><br />
Elm and willow, poplar, ash,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon you will remember these.</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i058.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Fig. 3.&mdash;fox&#39;s den" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;<span class='smcap'>fox&#39;s den</span></span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The children should see leaves from each
tree, and country children should be shown
the trees themselves with the leaves growing
on them. The 'den' of the 'fox' is at the edge
of the 'forest,' and is made by ten children
standing as shown in fig. 3. The four
children who form the entrance join hands
as shown, and the other six meet hands in
centre. A better way of making the den
would be for each child to hold a branch of
a tree, then the <i>branches</i> would meet instead
of the hands. The children who stand for
'trees' in the 'forest' wave branches, if the
latter are obtainable; if not, the arms are
waved for branches. One of the bigger girls
should be the 'fox,' and two or three of the
smallest children should be cubs, and go into
the den with the fox. Then the fox comes
walking out of the den, and says:</p>

<div class='poem'>
I go to find a duck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For dinner this fine day,</span><br />
And you, my pretty cubs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will stay at home and play.</span><br />
</div>

<p>While she is absent, the tiger comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
softly into the den and takes one of the cubs
(leading the child away by the hand).
Presently the fox returns, goes into the den,
misses the cub, and chases the tiger.</p>


<div class='center'><br />24. <i>THE COACH GAME</i></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/i060.png" width="225" height="241" alt="Number diagram" title="" />
</div>

<p>The 'coach' is formed by children
standing in position as shown on diagram.
All the children face the same way. 1, 2, 3, 4
are 'horses' and join hands behind, as in
'Bell-horses'; 5, 6, 7, 8 join hands to make
the front part of the 'coach'; '5' holds the
coat of 'horse' No. 1 with right hand, while
'8' holds coat of '4' with left; 9, 10, 11,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
12 each hold the dress of the child standing
in front; 13, 14, 15, 16 join hands; '13'
catches hold of No. 11 with right hand, and
'16' holds the dress of No. 12 with left.
When the 'coach' is ready, the 'driver' (a
boy) repeats the lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Here is my coach, who'll come and ride?<br />
The door, you see, is open wide.<br />
</div>

<p>Four 'passengers' advance, and the
'driver' makes way for them to enter the
'coach' between '10' and '12,' saying:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Jump in quick! quick! not long we stay,<br />
Then ready! steady! right away!<br />
</div>

<p>The 'door' is closed by '12' again grasping
the dress of '10,' and the 'coach' moves
off. The 'horses' should not go very quickly,
else the 'coach' will probably lose its shape.
The 'passengers' walk along with the
'coach' until their destination is reached,
when the 'driver' opens the door and allows
them to alight.</p>

<p>The above game may be played in conjunction
with Nos. <a href="#Game_25">25</a>, <a href="#Game_26">26</a> and <a href="#Game_27">27</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_25" id="Game_25"></a>25. <i>THE STABLE</i></div>

<p>This game may be played immediately
after 'The Coach,' or it may be played
alone.</p>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;The 'stable' is formed by a
number of children who stand in rows (see
diagram) and join hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i062.png" width="400" height="156" alt="Chidlren forming the stable diagram" title="" />
</div>

<p>The 'hostler' (a boy) should stand near
the 'stable.' When the 'coach' (Game
No. 24, <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>) drives up, he goes to the
driver and asks:</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Hostler</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Shall I take your horses for a rest and feed?<br />
They are tired, I think, sir, and a drink they need.<br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Driver</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Yes, good hostler, take and give them nice fresh corn,<br />
With a pail of water; they have worked since morn.<br />
</div>

<p>The 'hostler' leads one horse into each
stall, and pretends to give them hay or corn.
Then he carries water to them in a pail
(a toy pail, price 1<i>d.</i>, would do), and each
drinks. After this he rubs them down, using
a brush or his hand.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_26" id="Game_26"></a>26. <i>VISITING GRANDMAMMA</i></div>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;Four little girls are selected
to visit grandmamma, and to carry messages
and presents to her. Grandma's 'house' is
made by a ring of children (see <a href="#Page_ii">Frontispiece</a>,
and description of same on <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>), and the
girl who is to be 'Grandma' sits in the ring
knitting. An old-fashioned kerchief and
cap help to make the 'grandma' more real,
and a pair of spectacles adds further to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
effect. If the 'coach' game be used in conjunction
with this, the little girls may be
the 'passengers' and go in the 'coach' to
grandma's house. The 'door' (see description
of <a href="#Page_ii">Frontispiece</a> on <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>) should be
opened by a little maid, then the four
children enter and repeat the lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Children altogether</span></span><br />
Good morning, grandma, we have come<br />
With messages from all at home.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">First Child</span></span><br />
Mamma sends love, and I'm to say<br />
She hopes you are quite well to-day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">[Grandma replies suitably.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><span class="smcap">Second Child</span></span><br />
These flowers, dear grandma, are for you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">[Gives her flowers.]</span><br />
In my small garden bed they grew.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Grandma</span></span><br />
Thank you, my dear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Third Child</span> [<i>handing a basket</i>]</span><br />
And here are cakes that Nellie made<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>To send to grandmamma, she said.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Fourth Child</span> [<i>giving basket to grandma</i>]</span><br />
Ripe fruit I bring for grandmamma,<br />
These pears and plums are from papa.<br />
</div>

<p>When 'grandma' has thanked each of
the children, they take leave of her and
return home.</p>

<p>The Guessing Rhyme, No. <a href="#Game_92">92</a>, might be
given after playing the above game.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><a name="Game_27" id="Game_27"></a>27. <i>PAYING CALLS</i></div>

<p><i>Directions.</i>&mdash;A ring of children form the
'house' (see <a href="#Page_ii">Frontispiece</a>, and description of
same on <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>) or a classroom may be used
for it. A few chairs and a table should be
placed in the 'house,' and there should be a
'mother' and 'children.' A 'lady' (represented
by a little girl) comes and knocks at
the 'door,' and the 'mother' opens it.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Visitor</span></span><br />
How do you do, dear Mrs. Brown?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>I've called upon you going to town.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Mother</span></span><br />
I'm quite well, thank you, Mrs. May,<br />
And glad to see you this fine day.<br />
</div>

<p>The visitor then walks in and speaks to
the children one by one; they should answer
without hesitation. Children are generally
very shy and awkward when addressed by
strangers, but they should be encouraged to
reply with confidence and ease. Perhaps
these little games may help to give them
confidence.</p>

<p>The game 'Paying Calls' might appropriately
be followed by 'Afternoon Tea';
both these are played with great glee by the
little girls.</p>


<div class='center'><br />28. <i>AFTERNOON TEA</i></div>

<p>The tea-tray is brought in by one of the
children and placed on a table near the
'mother,' who pours out the tea. One of
the children carries a cup to the visitor,
and hands it to her, asking:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Will you take a cup of tea?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Visitor</span></span><br />
Yes, refreshing it will be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">[Takes the cup and says 'Thank you.']</span><br />
</div>

<p>A plate or d'oyley may be placed in the
lap of the visitor for the bread or biscuit,
which the child hands, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Bread and butter, biscuits, cake.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Visitor</span></span><br />
Please a biscuit I will take.<br />
</div>

<p>The 'mother' may serve the children
with tea, or there may be other visitors
calling, then the time of the children will
be occupied in attending to them.</p>

<p>When Mrs. May has finished, the child
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Shall I take your cup away,<br />
And your plate, too, Mrs. May?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">[Takes them away.]</span><br />
</div>

<p>By-and-by the visitor takes leave of the
'mother' and children, bidding each 'Good-day,'
and the 'door' is opened for her by
one of the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />29. <i>SPRING FLOWERS</i></div>

<p>All the children join to form a large ring,
and one of the taller girls stands in the
centre to represent 'Spring.' The twelve
flowers mentioned in the verses should be
represented by twelve children standing at
intervals in the ring. Before commencing
the game, the child who represents 'Spring'
might appropriately repeat the lines of
Guessing Rhyme No. 74, p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.</p>

<p>The 'Flowers' step forward from the
larger ring as the name of each is mentioned
in the verses, and form a smaller circle
round 'Spring.' The children should join
hands to close up the gap which is left by
each 'Flower' as it steps forward to join the
small circle.</p>

<div class='poem'>

<p>'Spring' marches round inside the larger

<div class='center'><br />30. <i>SUMMER FLOWERS</i></div>

<p>This game is played like the game of
'Spring Flowers' (see instructions on p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl chosen to represent 'Summer'
may repeat the verse given in Guessing

step forward as their names are mentioned in
the rhymes which follow.</p>

<p>The 'Flowers' then dance round
'Summer.'</p>


<div class='center'><br />31. <i>THE THREE BEARS</i></div>

<p>This game may be played either in
the home, schoolroom or classroom. The
words should be learnt previously as a
recitation.</p>

<p><i>Materials required.</i>&mdash;Three mugs or
basins of various sizes, with a spoon in each;
three stools or chairs of various sizes, and
three beds. The latter may be made by
laying shawls or coats on the forms or floor.
The 'beds' should vary in size, the first
being the largest, the next smaller, the third
smaller still.</p>

<p>Three boys or girls should be chosen to
represent the Three Bears, and these also
should vary in size. The 'Bears' go outside
the room.</p>

<p>The child who represents the little girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
should know the rhymes well. When all is
ready she comes in and, standing near the
open door, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
What a funny house I see!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Surely I may step inside,</span><br />
All is quiet as can be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the door is open wide.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[Walks slowly towards the mugs.]</span><br />
<br />
Pots of food are near the fire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I must taste them, one [tastes the first], two [tastes the second], three [tastes the third];</span><br />
Oh, how good, I'll eat it all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For my breakfast it shall be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[Puts the mug down and turns to stools.]</span><br />
<br />
Three stools! first [sits on first] and next [sits on it] too high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tiny one is just for me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">[Sits on third.]</span><br />
Oh, 'tis broken [tumbles off], off I go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What else is there yet to see?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">[Walks towards beds.]</span><br />
<br />
Beds, a large one [lies down], that is hard, [Rises.]<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">This one [pointing to middle bed] is too long, I fear,</span><br />
Oh, how soft [lies down in little bed], I'll take a rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the little bed just here.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">[Pretends to sleep.]</span><br />
</div>

<p>The three bears come tramping in. The
big one takes up his mug and says, 'Who
has been at my porridge?' The second bear
says the same; and then the little bear takes
up his mug and says, 'Who has been at my
porridge and eaten it all up?'</p>

<p>They proceed in the same way with the
stools, the little bear finishing with 'Who
has been sitting on my stool, and broken
it?'</p>

<p>Then they go to the beds in order, asking
one after the other, 'Who has been at my
bed?' until it comes to the little bear's turn,
when he says, 'Who has been at my bed?
and here she is still!'</p>

<p>The little girl now opens her eyes, and,
seeing the bears, jumps up quickly and
runs off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />32. <i>IMITATING CRIES OF ANIMALS</i></div>

<p>(A simple game for the very smallest
children.)</p>

<p>One child comes out to stand in front of
the class and says:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Listen to the cry I make,<br />
Then, if you the trouble take,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You may guess my name.</span><br />
</div>

<p>He then imitates the cry of some animal,
the 'bark' of a dog, the 'mew' of a cat, or
the 'crowing' of the cock, and the children
who wish to answer hold out the hand.
The child who is allowed to give the name
of the animal represented by the cry comes
out (if the answer is correct) and makes the
cry of another animal, first repeating the
lines as before. The following are some of
the cries that the children may be able to
imitate, 'cluck, cluck' (hen), 'quacking'
(duck), 'hissing' (goose), 'neighing' (horse),
'braying' (donkey), 'grunting' (pig), 'chirping'
(bird) or talking like the parrot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />33. <i>CHARADES</i></div>

<p><i>Preliminary.</i>&mdash;Everyone knows how fond
children are of representing ideas by action.
It is for this reason that charades are
recommended here. It will, of course, be
necessary for the teacher to assist and
suggest, but the children soon acquire confidence,
and their acting, being perfectly
natural, is often remarkably good.</p>

<p>A very simple little charade is given as
an example.</p>

<p>The children who are to take part go out
of the room for a few minutes with the
teacher. We will suppose the word chosen
is</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Tea-cake</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Act I.</span>&mdash;The teacher is to be the 'mother'
and the rest are children. The 'mother'
enters and sits down; presently the children
come trooping in from school and gather
round her. She asks what they have been
doing at school, each one tells her something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about its work or play, and then one child
asks, 'May we have tea, mother, please?'
'Yes,' says the mother, 'go and take off
your hats and we will get it ready.' (End
of Act I.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act II.</span>&mdash;The tea-table is prepared (see
Game No. <a href="#Game_1">1</a>, which is similar) and the
children sit down to tea. (The 'guessing'
children should be told to listen carefully to
what is said during tea.) One child asks
for the <i>cake</i> to be passed, another for bread
and butter, and so on. (End of Act II.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act III.</span>&mdash;In the last act the whole word
is to be given. The children pretend to
have a baker's shop (see 'Shopping Game,'
No. 6), one child keeps the shop, and the
rest come to buy. One asks for a loaf,
another for rolls, a third buys a <i>tea-cake</i>,
and so on.</p>

<p>Bricks and tablets may be used for the
loaves and cakes, or they may be made in
the clay-modelling lesson and kept for this
game.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Finding the word.</i>&mdash;The children who
have been listening are now asked to guess,
and may be encouraged by remarks, such as,
'Think of the first act, and what the
children said to their mother.'</p>

<p>'Remember the tea-table and what was
said there.'</p>

<p>Some of the words thus obtained may
be written on the blackboard, words for each
act being put in separate columns.</p>

<p>'Now what did the baker sell?' In this
way the answer is soon obtained.</p>

<p>It is well worth while to help the children
to learn how to play charades, because it
makes such a pleasant home-play for them
in wintry and wet weather.</p>


<div class='center'><br />34. <i>PASSING THE STICK</i></div>

<p>The children sit round the room, or
stand in a semi-circle. The teacher should
start the game, standing at the left extremity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the semi-circle, with the stick in her right
hand, and repeat the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
On the floor you see I <a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>tap my <a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>stick, <a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>stick, <a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>stick,<br />
Then I <a name="FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_57" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>pass it to my <a name="FNanchor_3_58" id="FNanchor_3_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_58" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>neighbour quick, quick, quick,<br />
If you know it, then please do the trick, trick, trick.<br />
</div>

<p>The children who do not know the game
will probably <i>omit</i> to pass the stick into the
left hand; as each one tries to do the trick,
the teacher says 'right' or 'wrong' as the
case may be, and those who are wrong are
told to notice particularly how the teacher
does it.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>NOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_56" id="Footnote_1_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_56"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Tap floor.</p></div>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />35. <i>FINDING THE THIMBLE</i></div>

<p>This is a favourite game and can be
played with very little noise. At home, <i>all</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the children would go out of the room
except the one who remains behind to hide
the thimble, but when played in the school
or classroom, it will be sufficient if six
children are sent out.</p>

<p>The thimble is to be placed where it can
be seen, the children are then called in, and
the one who has hid it says:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Try to find the thimble out,<br />
Use your eyes and look about,<br />
Look before and look behind,<br />
And when you the thimble find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Just sit down.</span><br />
</div>

<p>As soon as any child sees the thimble,
he takes a seat and remains quite still until
all the seekers have seen it, and each in
turn has sat down. Then the child who
<i>first</i> saw the thimble takes it from its hiding-place,
and has the privilege of remaining
behind to hide it next time. Different
children should go out each time, so that all
may have a turn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />36. <i>THROWING THE HANDKERCHIEF</i></div>

<p>The children stand in a ring, or sit round
the room, one child standing in the middle.
The handkerchief is thrown from one to
another, and the one who is 'out' tries to
find a child with the handkerchief in its
hand. As soon as he can do this, the child
who was caught with the handkerchief has
to stand in the centre, and the other one
sits down, or stands in the ring, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>As the game begins, the children say:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The handkerchief is thrown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Find quickly where 'tis gone:</span><br />
From you to me, from me to you,<br />
To keep it long will never do.<br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />37. <i>PICKING UP POTATOES</i></div>

<p>Take twelve potatoes and place them in
two rows of six each, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i081.png" width="250" height="51" alt="How to lay the potoatoes" title="" />
</div>

<p>Two medium-sized spoons are required
with which to take up the potatoes, and a
basket is placed two or three yards away to
receive them.</p>

<p>Two children are chosen to pick up the
potatoes, one standing at the end of each
row. The rest of the children may be
grouped on the gallery, or may stand round
in a ring.</p>

<p>The following verse is repeated either by
teacher alone, or by all the children, as the
spoon is handed to each child.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Take this spoon, and with it see<br />
That you lift so carefully<br />
These potatoes. One! two! three!<br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The last three words are said slowly, and
the game is to begin immediately 'three' is
said. The child who gets his row of
potatoes <i>first</i> picked up and deposited in the
basket wins the game. The potatoes are
not to be touched, except by the spoon, and
they are to be carried one by one in the
spoon to the basket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II. GAMES FOR THE PLAYGROUND</h2>


<div class='center'><br />38. <i>THROWING THE BALL</i></div>

<p>One child holds the ball in her hand and
stands at a little distance from the wall
against which it is to be thrown. The
other children are gathered near in a group
or semi-circle. When all are ready, the
children say:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Throw the ball against the wall,<br />
Then we'll listen for your call.<br />
</div>

<p>The child who is holding the ball
replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>'One, two, three, Pollie Burton' (supposing
that to be the name of the child
called), and throws the ball, all the children
running off except the one whose name was
mentioned. If the latter is successful in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
catching the ball, it is returned to the girl
who had it first and the game is repeated,
another name being substituted. If the ball
is not caught, the child who was called picks
it up and runs after the other children until
she manages to hit some one with it. The
child who is hit picks up the ball and all
return to the starting place. The lines are
again repeated and the game proceeds as
before.</p>


<div class='center'><br />39. <i>LAME LASSIE</i></div>

<p>At the commencement of the game the
children stand in a large ring, and the girl
who is to be 'Lame lassie' stands in the
centre. The children then say:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Now Lame lassie give us chase,<br />
Get one quick to fill your place.<br />
</div>

<p>They all run off, and 'Lame lassie'
follows until she manages to touch some
other child. Wherever the latter is
touched, she must place her hand on that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
particular spot and run after the others until
she is successful in reaching some one else.
Sometimes a child will be holding its
shoulder or elbow, or it may have to hold
up one leg and hop on the other. This is a
game which causes much fun and merriment.</p>


<div class='center'><br />40. <i>POLLY FLINDERS</i></div>

<p>The children form a ring, joining hands,
and one child sits in the middle. Those
who form the ring walk round singing to the
tune of 'The Keel Bow.'</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here's Polly Flinders,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sits on the cinders,</span><br />
Waits for a fairy to come and bring her news.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stand upon your feet, dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take a look around here,</span><br />
Kiss the one you love best, the one you like to choose.<br />
</div>

<p>At the word 'stand' the child in the
centre rises to her feet, and when the rhyme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
is ended she chooses a child to take her
place in the centre and returns to the ring.
All the children stand still while the choice
is being made.</p>


<div class='center'><br />41. <i>DROP, DROP, DROP</i></div>

<p>The children stand eighteen inches
apart in a ring, <i>not</i> joining hands.</p>

<p>One child walks round the ring, holding
a handkerchief in her hand, and repeating
the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
One, two, three,<br />
Come follow me,<br />
Drop, drop, drop,<br />
Where shall I stop?<br />
</div>

<p>At the word 'stop,' she drops the handkerchief
near one of the children, and runs;
the child picks it up and follows her as she
threads her way in and out of the ring,
until she is caught. Then the 'chaser'
goes round the ring with the handkerchief,
repeating the rhyme, and the child who was
caught stands in the other one's place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />42. <i>PUSS IN THE CORNER</i></div>

<p>This game may be played by four
children, each standing at a corner, with one
in the centre for 'pussy,' or it maybe played
by a ring of children.</p>

<p>The child who is 'pussy' stands in the
centre of the ring, and the others say:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Pussy cat, pussy cat looking so spry,<br />
Might very soon catch us, if she would but try.<br />
</div>

<p>Two children then beckon to each other
and exchange places. (If a ring is formed,
the two children should come from opposite
sides of it.) As they are crossing, 'pussy'
tries to catch one of them; if she succeeds,
the child who is caught stands in the centre,
and the old 'pussy' takes her place in the
ring or corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />43. <i>WOLF AND SHEEP</i></div>

<p>One child is the 'wolf' and stands on
one side of the playground, while the rest
of the children are 'sheep,' and stand in a
row on the opposite side.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Wolf</i>: Where's your shepherd, pretty sheep?<br />
<i>Sheep</i>: In his cottage, fast asleep.<br />
<i>Wolf</i>: I will catch you as you run,<br />
<i>Sheep</i>: If we let you, there's the fun!<br />
</div>

<p>The 'wolf' and 'sheep' then change
sides, and in crossing the 'wolf' touches as
many of the 'sheep' as she can; these all
go to her side and help to catch more
'sheep' next time. The game proceeds
until all the 'sheep' are caught except one,
and that one is 'wolf' next time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />44. <i>DANCING GAME</i></div>

<p>The children stand in two rows facing
each other, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i089.png" width="300" height="105" alt="How to line up for the dance" title="" />
<span class="caption">How to line up for the dance</span>
</div>

<p>The following is sung to the tune of
'Pop Goes the Weasel.'</p>

<div class='poem'>
Have you seen my monkey, Jack?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gay old Jack, so funny!</span><br />
He can climb, or nuts can crack,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or take your money.</span><br />
</div>

<p>As the children begin to sing, '<b>a</b>' and
'<b>b</b>' join hands and dance down to '<b>o</b>,' then
change hands and dance back again to [];
then '<b>a</b>' goes behind '<b>e</b>' as shown by line
'<b>g</b>,' and stands at '<b>c</b>,' while '<b>b</b>' goes behind
'<b>f</b>,' following the line '<b>h</b>' and stands at '<b>d</b>';<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
'<b>e</b>' and '<b>f</b>' proceed in the same way, and
each couple follows in turn.</p>


<div class='center'><br />45. <i>DUCKING UNDER</i></div>

<p>The children stand in rows facing each
other, each child holding the handkerchief
of its opposite partner, and so helping to
make a long tunnel. As they stand thus
the verse is repeated:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Ducking under is the game,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are you ready, children, all?</span><br />
Hold your handkerchiefs quite fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then run under when I call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">One, two, three.</span><br />

</div>

<p>At 'three,' '<b>a</b>' and '<b>b</b>' run under, and
stand at '<b>c</b>' and '<b>d</b>' respectively, extending
handkerchiefs as quickly as possible, so that
the next couple may be able to pass under.
The couple who stood next '<b>a</b>' and '<b>b</b>' at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

and so on until the 'tunnel' has moved
round the playground.</p>

</div>

<p>The children stand behind each other in
couples at one end of the playground, ready
to dance off when the song begins. They
start from point '<b>b</b>,' and each holds his
partner's hand until the other end of the
playground is reached, point '<b>a</b>,' then the
hands are dropped; one goes to the left
(following direction of arrow '<b>c</b>'), the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the right (arrow '<b>d</b>'), and they meet
again at the starting point '<b>b</b>,' where they
join hands and repeat the movement.</p>

<p>The following is sung to the tune of
'Weel may the Keel Row.'</p>

<div class='poem'>
Who'll go a-hunting, a-hunting, a-hunting,<br />
Oh! who'll go a-hunting this merry, merry day?<br />

Then who'll go a-hunting this merry, merry day?<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />47. <i>SHEEP GATHERING</i></div>

<p>Two rows of children are formed facing
each other, with a long chalk line between.
The children join hands.</p>

<p>[The first row advances to the chalk line, singing:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Key F.</span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i093.png" width="400" height="88" alt="Sheep Gathering Song Part 2" title="" />
</div>

<p>[Second line retires, and first again advances singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Mary Burton [or any other name] is the name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">so send her right away, away,</span><br />
</div>

<p>[Second line advances as first retires and sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Johnny Smith [or any other name] will come to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">fetch her, then begins the play.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The two children named then come out,
and joining hands with the line between
them, try to pull each other over the line.
If the child from first line succeeds, then
both children join that line, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>,
and the game begins again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />48. <i>HOPPING GAME</i></div>

<p>Squares are chalked on the ground,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/i094.png" width="166" height="400" alt="Hopping Game diagram" title="" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><br />and a stone or pebble is put at the place
marked <b>&times;</b>.</div>

<p>The object of the game is to pass the
pebble into each square with one foot only,
following the numbers in order. The child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
who is to begin the game stands near the
pebble, while the children say:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Here is a game for you, hippity, hop,<br />
Into the next place you make the stone pop.<br />
</div>

<p>The child then sends the stone into No.
1 square (hopping on one foot), from that
into Nos. 2, 3, 4 and so on. If the stone be
sent outside the square into which it should
go, the player is out, and another begins.
The child who first gets the pebble into No.
10 square, having passed it into each of the
others successively, keeping on one foot all
the time, wins the game.</p>


<div class='center'><br />49. <i>MAKING A CHAIN</i></div>

<p>The game is started by one child who
catches another and says:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
I have caught you, come away,<br />
Let us make a chain to-day.<br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The two then join hands and catch
another, repeating the same words; then the
three start off and catch another, and so on
until all are caught.</p>

<p>The last child caught starts the game
again, or the completed 'chain' may form a
ring and play one of the ring games, Nos.
40, 41, 42.</p>


<div class='center'><br />50. <i>MOTHER, MAY WE GO OUT TO PLAY?</i></div>

<p>One corner of the playground may be
the 'house' in which the 'mother' sits. If
the game is played by the children elsewhere,
they will probably mark out the shape
of the 'house' on the ground with stones or
pebbles, a practice of which they are very
fond. The children come to the 'house'
where the 'mother' sits, and standing in
front of her, ask:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Children</i>:   Mother, may we go out and play?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mother</i>: Yes, good children, that you may.</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The children then run away, and after
a little while return to the mother; she
asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mother:</i> Where have you been?</span><br />
<i>Children:</i>   Away up the hill.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mother:</i> What have you seen?</span><br />
<i>Children:</i>   A house by a mill.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mother:</i> Who was there in it?</span><br />
<i>Children:</i>   A little, old man.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mother:</i> What said he to you?</span><br />
<i>Children:</i>   Catch me if you can.<br />
</div>

<p>The children then run off, and the
'mother' chases until she has caught one
or more; these are kept prisoners in the
'house,' and the game proceeds until all are
caught except one, and she is the 'mother'
when the game begins again.</p>

<h2>III. GUESSING RHYMES</h2>


<p><i>Notes.</i>&mdash;The Guessing Rhymes are intended
to be read by the teacher to the
children, who then try to find out the word.
The verse should be repeated slowly two or
three times before the children are asked to
guess. At first only the familiar and well-known
objects should be given, and even then
it will sometimes be necessary to assist the
imagination of the children by a question or
two. Before reading the rhyme, the teacher
should say whether it is a flower, object or
animal, &amp;c., that is to be guessed.</p>

<p>The rhymes about animals, flowers, and
natural phenomena will not be difficult to
the children if these subjects have been
included in their object lessons, or have
formed the subject of 'morning talks' (see
p. 14, 'Kindergarten Guide').<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nursery Rhymes will have been
learnt by the children when they were in the
Babies' class, and the rest of the rhymes
belong to fairy tales that are commonly told
to all children.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
